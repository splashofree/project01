1.Philosophy 
As we all know, water is undoubtedly the most precious and priceless natural resource available to all forms of life on Earth. As land pressure rises, more and more marginal areas in the world are being used for agriculture. Much of this land is located in the arid or semi-arid belts where rain falls irregularly and much of the precious water is soon lost as surface runoff. Recent droughts have highlighted the risks to human beings and livestock, which occur when rains falter or fail.
The construction and use of cisterns to store rainwater can be traced back to the Neolithic Age, when waterproof lime plaster cisterns were built in the floors of houses in village locations of the Levant, a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bound by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east. By the late 4000 BC, cisterns were essential elements of emerging water management techniques used in dry-land farming
While irrigation may be the most obvious response to drought, it has proved costly and can only benefit a fortunate few. There is now increasing interest in a low-cost alternative - generally referred to as "water harvesting".

2. Rainwater Harvesting
As we all know, water is undoubtedly the most precious and priceless natural resource available to all forms of life on Earth. As land pressure rises, more and more marginal areas in the world are being used for agriculture. Much of this land is located in the arid or semi-arid belts where rain falls irregularly and much of the precious water is soon lost as surface runoff. Recent droughts have highlighted the risks to human beings and livestock, which occur when rains falter or fail.
While irrigation may be the most obvious response to drought, it has proved costly and can only benefit a fortunate few. There is now increasing interest in a low-cost alternative - generally referred to as "water harvesting".
By definition, rainwater harvesting refers to a process involving three steps designed to collect rainwater accumulating on surfaces like roofs, storing it properly and distributing it later for outdoor & indoor applications. Rainwater is a sustainable, safe and economical source of clean and quality water – all one needs to do is know how to capture & store it in the right way. It is much safer compared to the water distributed via mains since the latter is treated using chemicals for eliminating bacteria and later pumped through pipes that might contain harmful contaminants like rust.
In general, rainwater harvesting is a simple water-saving technique that can be carried out easily on clean roofs. But what if the roof of a property is dirty? There is a solution for that too – installation of several rain diverters or first flush devices which are readily available in the market. These devices are designed specifically to flush or divert the foremost water flow from a storm. As such, any bacteria, dirt or other contaminants present on the dirty roof does not get a chance to enter the storage tank
2.1 Purpose
i. Rainwater is a safe form of water because it is not contaminated with chemicals and industrial refuse. This is the best way to make fresh water available.
ii. Houses that have rainwater harvesting are self- sufficient. They will not need to buy water and this makes the process economically viable as well.
iii. If rainwater is stored properly, we will not need to exploit natural resources like groundwater and rivers.
iv. Rainwater harvesting will also help manage the water crisis and avoid flood and droughts.
v. With rainwater being used and reused, we will be able to better manage the underground water table. This will avoid the water crisis in the future.
2.2 Scope
Scope of rainwater harvesting manifests the possibilities of rainwater storage in an area or location. Though rain falls infrequently over space and time in the study area yet harvesting this available rainwater can provide water for regions where other sources are too distant, costly and limited. Once the rainwater has been harvested, it can be used for crop production and life-saving irrigation during the drought-like conditions. Consequently, the present section assesses the possibilities to capture the available rainwater in the existing and proposed storages with the help of suitable strategies. The procedural steps while critically assessing the potential and scope for rainwater harvesting in an are as follows:



i. The starting point is the identification and quantification
of naturally occurring runoff and its current use,
through processing and interpretation of hydrological
data.

ii. Even when there is a potential of harvesting runoff in the local areas, the runoff may already be committed to other
users in the downstream areas. The potential for Rainwater Harvesting in the local areas should, therefore, be assessed to other water users in the catchment/basin or other study units as a whole.

Scope of rainwater harvesting in a particular area depends on the availability of sites, climatic conditions (especially rainfall) and catchment characteristics. Reliable rainfall data of a certain period in a given catchment is required to design the potential rainwater supply of that catchment. The pattern and frequency of rainy days are also an important factor for designing rainwater harvesting. The fewer the annual rainy days or longer the dry period, the more need for rainwater collection in a region.


2.3 Problem Statement
The availability of clean, safe and sufficient amount of water to the daily activities of the human
being is very crucial. Water plays an important role in transforming or changing the lives of
people to a better and healthier one. Access to a sufficient amount of water is a major problem for
most people living in rural and urban areas.




3.Applications
Designed for Non-potable applications, interpump commercial rainwater harvesting systems primarily use efficient multistage pumps and VFD’s to maintain required system pressures. Filtration equipment will vary depending on water use and can include a combination of membrane, UV and chlorine treatment. In situations requiring a municipal standby water connection, an appropriate backflow prevention device will need to be installed.
All our RWH packages are fully tested hydrostatically and are ESA certified. The sequence of operation is programmed into our system and tested in our facility to recreate the needs required for your unique application. Our control panels fully monitor all aspects of the system 
Water harvesting in commercial projects involves collecting rooftop rainwater, stormwater runoff, condensate from air handlers and greywater from showers, baths, and lavatory sinks. This water is reused for non-potable applications such as toilet flushing, irrigation and cooling towers.
4. Technology
4.1 HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
•    Hypertext refers to how Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
•    As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.
This tutorial is designed for the aspiring Web Designers and Developers with a need to understand the HTML in enough detail along with its simple overview, and practical examples. This tutorial will give you enough ingredients to start with HTML from where you can take yourself at a higher level of expertise.

4.2 CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the world wide web, alongside HTML and javascript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on mobile devices.
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.
In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
Selectors may apply to the following:
•    all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
•    elements specified by an attribute, in particular:
o    id: an identifier unique within the document
o    class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document
•    elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is hover, which identifies content only when the user “points to” the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a: hover or #elementid: hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as a link or: visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as::first-line or::first-letter.[6]
Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.
4.3 Three js
Three.js allows the creation of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins. This is possible due to the advent of WebGL.
High-level libraries such as Three.js or GLGE, SceneJS, PhiloGL or several other libraries make it possible to author complex 3D computer animations that display in the browser without the effort required for a traditional standalone application or a plugin.
With the help of three js, we create the scenes and load the objects from the sketch fab. The overall functionality was based on the three js only and the animations are also occurring due to the three js. 

Features of three js are as follows:-
•    Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.
•    Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog
•    Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more
•    Animation: armatures, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, morph and keyframe
•    Lights: ambient, direction, point, and spotlights; shadows: cast and receive
•    Materials: Lambert, Phong, smooth shading, textures and more
•    Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) capabilities: lens flare, pass, and extensive post-processing library
•    Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of detail
•    Geometry: plane, cube, sphere, torus, 3D text and more; modifiers: lathe, extrude and tube
•    Data loaders: binary, image, JSON and scene
•    Utilities: full set of time and 3D math functions including frustum, matrix, quaternion, UVs and more
•    Export and import: utilities to create Three.js-compatible JSON files from within Blender, openCTM, FBX, max, and obj.






4.4 JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with the first-class function. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specific to Web pages, please see WEB API and DOM.
Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.

JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:
•    Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
•    Third-party APIs — Allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
•    Third-party frameworks and libraries — you can apply these to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.
Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to confuse you at this stage by talking in detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript language and the different tools listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on, in our JavaScript learning area, and the rest of MDN.













5. Tools
5.1 Blender
The 3D View is used to interact with the 3D scene for a variety of purposes, such as modeling, animation, texture painting, etc.
Header
The header contains various menus and controls based on the current model.
 

Menus
View
This menu offers tools to navigate in 3D space.
Select
Contains tools for selecting objects.
Add
Gives a list of different objects types that can be added to a scene.
Object
This menu appears when in Object Mode. it contains tools to edit objects. In edit mode, it will change to the appropriate menu with editing tools.
Controls
Mode
The 3D View has several modes used for editing different kinds of data:
•    Object Mode
•    Edit Mode
•    Sculpt Mode
•    Vertex Paint
•    Weight Paint
•    Texture Paint
•    Particle Edit
•    Pose Mode
•    Edit Strokes Mode
Viewport Shading
Allows you to change the way objects are displayed in the viewport. Read more about the different shading modes.
Pivot Point
Used to change the reference point (or pivot point) used by many mesh manipulation tools.
Read more about Pivot Points.
Transform Manipulator
These handy selectors allow you to rotate or move objects by grabbing (clicking with your mouse) their controls and moving your mouse in the axis.
Read more about Transform Manipulators.
Layer
The Layers Widget is documented in the Layers page.
Lock to Scene
By default, the “lock” button to the right of the layer buttons is enabled. This means that in this view, the active layers and camera are those of the whole scene (and those used at render time). Hence, all 3D Views locked this way will share the same active layers and camera. When you change them in one view, all locked others will immediately reflect these changes.
But if you disable this “lock” button, you then can specify different active layers and camera, specific to this view. This might be useful if you do not want to have your working areas (views) cluttered with the whole scene, and still, have an ancillary complete view (which is unlocked with e.g. all layers are shown). Or to have several views with different active cameras. Remember that you can use Ctrl-Numpad0 to make the active object the active camera.
